    "What happens in the range [128; 256) is not covered by the `ASCII` standard. In the 1990s, many encodings were standardized which used this range for their own purposes, usually representing additional accented characters used in a particular region. E.g. Czech (and Slovak, Polish...) alphabets can be represented using the ISO `latin-2` encoding, or Microsoft's `cp-1250`. Encodings which stick to the same character mappings as `ASCII` in the range [0; 128) **and represent them physically in the same way (as 1 byte)**, while potentially adding more character mappings beyond that, are called **`ASCII`-compatible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ASCII` compatibility is a good thing&trade;, because when you start reading a character stream in a computer, there's **no way to know in advance what encoding it is in** (unless it's a file you've encoded yourself). So in practice, a heuristic has been established to start reading the stream assuming it is `ASCII` by default, and switch to a different encoding if evidence becomes available that motivates it. For instance, HTML files should all start something like this:\n",

This trick works only if we can assume that whatever encoding the rest of the file is in, the first few lines can be considered as `ASCII` for all practical intents and purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the `charset` attribute, the only way to know if the encoding is right would be for you to look at the rendered text and see if it makes sense; if it did not, you'd have to resort to trial and error, manually switching the encodings and looking for the one in which the numbers behind the characters stop coming out as gibberish and are actually translated into intelligible text.\n",

    "In fact, it's **always a good idea to specify the encoding explicitly, using `UTF-8` as a default** if you don't know, for at least two reasons -- it makes your code more:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **portable** -- it will work the same across different operating systems which assume different default encodings;\n",
    "2. and **resistant to data corruption** -- `UTF-8` is more restrictive than fixed-width encodings, in the sense that not all sequences of bytes are valid `UTF-8`. E.g. if one byte starts with 11, then the following one *must* start with 10 (see above). If it starts with anything else, it's an error. By contrast, in a fixed-width encoding, *any* sequence of bytes is valid. Decoding will always succeed, but if you use the wrong fixed-width encoding, the result will be garbage, which you might not notice. Therefore, it makes sense to default to `UTF-8`: if it works, then there's a good chance that the file actually *was* encoded in `UTF-8` and you've read the data in correctly; if it fails, you get an explicit error which prompts you to investigate further.\n",

With variable-width encodings, which have to explicitly encode information about how many bits are spanned by each codepoint, this straightforward correspondence breaks down.\n",

Another great piece of material is the [Characters, Symbols and the Unicode Miracle](https://youtu.be/MijmeoH9LT4) video by the [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) channel on YouTube.

In any case, please let me know in the comments! I'm grateful for feedback and looking to improve this material; I'll fix the mistakes and consider ditching some of the simplifications if they prove untenable :)"
